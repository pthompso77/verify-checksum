# verify-checksum
A python application to simplify the process of verifying checksums of downloaded files. The application needs to be flexible enough to accommodate users who are not familiar with the specific algorithms at work, as well as having options to select the specific algorithm used to create the digest. One additional feature of this kind of tool is the ability to create checksums for those who are providing content for download and would like to offer end users the ability to verify the integrity of that data.
